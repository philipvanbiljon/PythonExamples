# Python Examples

The first two relate to Machine Learning and involved using the SKLearn, Seaborn, Numpy and Pandas libraries to manipulate datasets to discover more about the data and perform some classification tasks. The classification included training a Gaussian Naive Bayes Model and experiments using Multivariate Linear Regression.

The third file relates to a Natural Language Processing university project I worked on using NLTK. We were tasked with first training a Hidden Markov Model and then implementing the Viterbi Algorithm.


Finally, the fourth file is a script which I wrote to solve the quiz found on Gambit Researchâ€™s website (https://www.gambitresearch.com/quiz/)
